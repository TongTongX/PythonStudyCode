Project Title: Gomoku game

Description: 
We plan to develop the abstract strategy board game Gomoku (also called Five in a Row) using python, 
with the interface displayed on the computer screen. On a Go board with 15*15 intersections, two 
users (one has black stones and the other has white stones) alternate in placing one single stone 
of their color on an empty intersection. Once placed, stones are not moved or removed from the board. 
The winner is the first player to get an unbroken row of five stones of the one’s color horizontally, 
vertically, or diagonally. Note that it is not required to have a row of exactly five stones for a win;
a row of more than five stones also qualifies.

This project is comprised of two major components: searching algorithm and evaluating function.
1. Searching algorithm. 
	- MiniMax Game Tree: predicts and chooses the next move according to results from evaluating function
	- Alpha-Beta Pruning: decreases the number of nodes that are evaluated by the minimax 
	  algorithm in its search tree. 
2. Evaluating function
	Assign a value to each intersection on the board based on the rules of the game.

Milestones: 

1.
March 20
Basic algorithm implementation. Run test programs to print out the tree and other results. 
	a) MiniMax Game Tree
	b) Alpha-Beta Pruning
	c) Evaluating function 

2.
March 27
Implementation of the game. Use plaintext result to check if the outputs are correct. 
	a) main function
	b) other helper functions

3.
April 3
GUI. Apply Pygame or other third party library such as TkInter, wxPython, or PyQt.
	a) User Interface.
